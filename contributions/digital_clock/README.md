# DIGITAL CLOCK
This is a digital clock made using html css and javascript.
This is a good beginner project for learning some concepts of javascript

# Code Explanation
JAVASCRIPT--
  First i have created a function called clocks() in which we store the variable time.Now we gaet the time zone and date by using new date function which will return browser date and time zone.
  Now we extract the hours, minutes, and seconds from the variable time using the getHours(), getMinutes() and getSeconds() methods.These methods return the respective values when a date is passed, we store them in variables hour, min and sec.
  I have written a code to make it a 12 hr clock by using ternary function.
  I have use setTimeout function to run  our function every 1 sec.
  At last we display our function to the browser window by using document.getElementById
  
CSS--
 I have taken the fonts from google fonts and for background image I have used source.unsplash website.
 And then i apply basic css to make our clock look good
