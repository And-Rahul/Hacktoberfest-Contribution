## Grocery List 
In my daily life, I face the problem of making a grocery list without any application installed on my smartphone. Therefore I created this application to create a grocery list with the prices so I know that what things I should buy at what prices.

### Description
<p>This web application is developed using Node, Express, and MongoDB along with this I have used EJS with jQuery and AJAX to enable in-page data loading, so we do not have to reload the page to view the changes made in the database. In which I have made the complete CRUD operations on the grocery data, by using HTTP verbs. In this application, the person can edit the list items and can also delete it.</p>
