The idea of this project to come to a result just like flipping a coin and is fun. This project use HTML,CSS,Javascript. 

It uses Math.random() to generate a random number between 0-1.

Then multiplying the number with 6 and then using Math.floor()+1. We can get an integer between 1-6.

Then print the dice image of the number generated and compare the numbers.

Player which rolls big wins the game.
