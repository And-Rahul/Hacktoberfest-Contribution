# ANALOG CLOCK
## Tech Stack : 
`HTML, CSS, Javascript`

We use an image of the clock that will be used in the background, and on top of that, we will make an hour, minute, and second hand. 

These hands will rotate as per the system time using predefined Date function of JavaScript to calculate the degree of rotations of each hand.
To get the current time we used the Date() object provided by the JavaScript. This will give the current seconds, minutes, and hours respectively as the clock rotates 360 degrees. So, we will convert to convert the rotation of the hands of the clock into degrees
